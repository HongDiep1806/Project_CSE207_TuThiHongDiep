                            <h1>Phu Quy - Binh Thuan || 2023<br>Up-and-coming</h1>
                            <p>No visit to Binh Thuan province is complete without heading to Dao Phu Quy, which means
                                “island of riches”. Thanks to its stunning greenery and clear ocean waters, it’s also
                                been referred to as “the little Bali” or “Maldives” of Vietnam.</p>
                            <p> As the island is
                                quite far out, situated about 120km from Phan Thiet city in the East Sea, it has that
                                remote, wild allure. At the moment, it’s mostly young Vietnamese travelers ‘in the know’
                                who visit. So this is an up-and-coming destination that’s worth visiting while it
                                remains rather undiscovered.</p>
                            <p>The small island (16−18km2) is home to approximately 30,000 people, who live mainly
                                within three settlements: Tam Thanh, Ngu Phung, and Long Hai.

                            <h1>Phu Quy - Binh Thuan || 2023<br>What to Eat ?</h1>
                            <p>Naturally, since the island relies on fishing as its mainstay, Phu Quy is a paradise for
                                seafood-lovers. There are plenty of seafood restaurants. And a really fun thing to do is
                                to eat super-fresh catch on a fishing raft. In particular, you must try king crab, moon
                                crab, lobster, grouper, squid and snails.</p>
                            <p>The king crab is a plump crab known for its firm, sweet flesh. Given its size – and the
                                fact that it’s not easy to catch – king crabs are on the pricey side. Go ahead and treat
                                yourself.</p>
                            <p>The moon crab is another indulgence that’s notoriously hard to catch. It’s apparently so
                                named because of the round red dot pattern on its shell. Others say it’s most delicious
                                when caught and enjoyed during a moon rise.

                            <h1>Phu Quy - Binh Thuan || 2023<br>How to get there</h1>
                            <p>To get to Phu Quy island, you need to get to Phan Thiet City first. There’s no airport
                                there, so fly to Nha Trang, Ho Chi Minh City or Dalat. Then get a bus or train to Phan
                                Thiet. Then you’ll need to get to the port to catch a boat to the island. Depending on
                                the type of boat, the journey will take 2.5 to 3.5 hours. Travelers prone to getting
                                sea-sick are advised to take motion-sickness medication beforehand. On the island, you
                                rent a bicycle or motorbike, or arrange a taxi through your accommodation host.</p>
                            <p>So, what’s the best time to plan your trip? You can go during the dry season, between
                                December and June. But the ideal swimming months are March through April, when the seas
                                are calm. </p>
